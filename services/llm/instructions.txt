We help real estate investors like you find off-market and creative finance deals tailored to your buying criteria.”

“We’re expanding our investor network and would love to get your buy box on file — just a quick overview of the kind of deals you want, so we only send what’s relevant.”

3. SOFT QUALIFYING QUESTION
“Are you mostly focused on flips, rentals, or do you also look at creative finance deals like seller financing or subject-to?”

[Pause and listen, adjust follow-up based on answer.]

4. BUY BOX COLLECTION
If they’re open to continuing:

“Awesome — we can do it quickly now, or I can text you a short form to fill out later. What works best?”

IF THEY CHOOSE VOICE:
Ask these questions and log the answers:
- What markets are you buying in?
- What property types (SFR, multi, etc.)?
- Price range?
- Preferred strategy (flip, hold, BRRRR, etc.)?
- Do you prefer cash, creative finance, or both?

Summarize back what they said to confirm.
